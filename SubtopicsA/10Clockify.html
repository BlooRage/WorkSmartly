                            Clockify is a time tracking tool developed by Coing Inc. and launched in 2017 to help individuals and organizations gain better control over how their time is spent. Created by software engineers Nenad Milanovic and Lazar Vujanic, the tool was built to provide a free and accessible time management solution for users of all backgrounds. Clockify allows users to either log hours manually or use a built-in timer to track time spent on specific tasks or projects. It is especially useful for freelancers, remote workers, small teams, and businesses that need to track billable hours, monitor productivity, and maintain accurate time records. The platform also includes detailed time reports that break down usage patterns, making it easier to see where time is going and how it can be optimized.

                            Clockify offers additional features such as setting project budgets, assigning tasks to team members, and viewing real-time dashboards that display overall progress and team activity. The platform integrates with a wide range of popular tools including Trello, Asana, Jira, and Google Calendar, allowing it to fit seamlessly into existing workflows. It is available on the web as well as on desktop and mobile devices, ensuring users can track time from virtually anywhere. By providing transparency and detailed insights into daily activities, Clockify helps users make smarter, more informed decisions about their work and time management habits.
