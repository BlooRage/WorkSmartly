                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grammarly is a powerful writing assistant that helps users improve their writing by checking grammar, spelling, punctuation, and sentence structure. It was launched in 2009 by three developers—Alex Shevchenko, Max Lytvyn, and Dmytro Lider. Initially designed to assist university students with grammar mistakes and plagiarism, it quickly became popular and is now used by millions worldwide. Over time, its features expanded, and now it is not only used by students but also by teachers, professionals, and content creators from various industries.

Grammarly is powered by artificial intelligence and helps users write with clarity and confidence. As you type, it provides real-time suggestions by underlining errors and recommending corrections for grammar, word choice, and sentence structure. This makes it easy for users to spot mistakes and improve the quality of their writing instantly. It also helps improve the tone and style of writing, ensuring that messages are professional and clear.

Grammarly is available in two versions: free and premium. The free version covers basic grammar and spelling checks, while the premium version includes advanced features like tone adjustment, vocabulary enhancement, and a plagiarism checker—useful for academic or professional writing.

Grammarly can be used across various platforms, including web browsers, Microsoft Word, Google Docs, and mobile apps, making it accessible from anywhere. Overall, Grammarly is not just a simple spell checker; it’s a comprehensive writing assistant that helps users write with confidence, whether for school, work, or personal use.

At the bottom of the screen, you’ll see a score that summarizes the overall quality of your writing. This helps you monitor your progress. You can also set specific goals, such as your intended audience, formality level, and purpose of writing, which Grammarly takes into account when offering suggestions. The design is simple, with a focus on efficiency, ensuring a seamless experience across all platforms whether you're using the web version, desktop app, or mobile version.
