                                Brain.fm is a music streaming service that uses neuroscience principles to create music that enhances focus, improves sleep, and more. It uses sound to change brainwave patterns so you can drop into deep focus and fall asleep faster every time.

                                Founded in 2014 by Adam Hewett, This tool began as a focus-music company and has since expanded to support users in various aspects of their lives, becoming a leading name in science-backed music. The company's mission is to help people around the world to unlock their full potential by creating music that supports different mental states.

                                Brain.fm's music is engineered using a patented process called neural phase locking, which encourages your specific brainwave patterns associated with focus, relaxations, and sleep. Unlike traditional music, which is designed to capture attention, Brain.fm's compositions are made to fade into the background, minimizing distractions and enhancing cognitive performances.

Brain.fm's approach has been validated through studies involving fMRI (Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and EEG (Electroencephalography), demonstrating it's effectiveness in enhancing focus and reducing anxiety. 

                                By integrating neuroscience and music, Brain.fm provides a tool for individuals seeking to improve their mental states and productivity using Music.
