                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asana's UI focuses on sharp clarity, team collaboration and efficiency in task management. The entire design is clean and light themed and has a left hand vertical sidebar that connects to projects, inbox, reporting and team settings. The workspace is then dynamically updated on input or selection from task lists to Kanban boards, timelines or calendars. Each task has a checkbox, assigned user, due date and subtasks, so tracking can be done easily. On the top bar are found the searching, quick add, and profile settings.
                         Tasks are color coded, given icons and divided into sections without being aesthetically cluttered. Asana has the least distraction and maximum productivity and also allows inline comments and real time updates to run smooth collaboration. Its intuitive layout ensures that even first time users can navigate and manage their tasks with minimal guidance. </p>
