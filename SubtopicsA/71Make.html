                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make (formerly Integromat) is characterized by a modern interface with logic and modularity at its heart. The left sidebar provides fast access to Organization, Scenarios, Templates, and Webhooks, all neatly presented under 'My Team' for collaborative team automation. Here in the center, the interface draws its users into designing scenarios where the flow of events hence suggest, 'When this happens Do this.' This loud trigger action relationship provides clarity even to those who have never wandered through its wonders. Google Sheets, Gmail, and Slack, among others, are prominently displayed with large, recognizable icons selected by the user within a heartbeat. The top navigation offers additional controls with tabs for Teams, Payments, Installed Apps, etc., keeping order in an otherwise chaotic setup. Soft gradients, friendly icons, and a vibrant yet fluent "Create scenario" button work together to create a friendly yet productive workspace.</p>
