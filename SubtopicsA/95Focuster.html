                                Focuster is a tool that focuses on a management system that helps individuals to prioritize and manage their tasks by scheduling directly into the calendar. Focuster automatically manages tasks, and follows up with you until the tasks get it done.  

                                Founded by Jordan Baker, a software developer and productivity coach. Focuster was created to address the shortcomings of traditional to-do lists. Baker recognized that many productivity tools failed to account for time constraints and often led to stress and inefficiency. His solution was to develop a system that not only lists tasks but also schedules them intelligently, promoting a more focused and productive workflow.
